<h1>A Study on Mixed-Initiative GameLevel Design Tools: Consent Form</h1>

<div>
    <p>Tristan Barlow-Griffin undergraduate of the course BSc Computing For Games is working on a research project and would like to invite you to take part. Before you decide, you should familiarize yourself with why the research is being carried out and what it would involve for you.</p>
    <p>I am leading an investigation into how designers interact with a mixed-initiative level design tool for prototyping levels and how this tool affects the prototyping design process. You have been invited to this research because you have a certain level of skill at designing game levels.</p>
    <p>For this study, I am asking you to create five levels using the level tool provided. During this time the system will be gathering data only on how you interact with the tool. The purpose of the study is to gain insight into how the tool works with your design process. The focus of this study is not on your personal ability to design levels as such, no data will be gathered to that end. None of this data is personal and therefore no data gathered in this experiment can be used to identify you.</p>
    <p> All the data in this study is anonymous, no data in this study can be used to identify you, as such does not fall under the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. Further to this, your participation in this project is subject to the Code of Research Ethics of the higher education institution in which you are enrolled: Falmouth University. Data will be archived for the maximum period of time permitted under these regulations: 2 years.</p>
    <p> Please note, it is not compulsory to take part in this study, and you can withdraw at any time without consequences.
        If you have any queries or concerns, please contact tristanbarlowg@gmail.com. If you have any complaints regarding the ethical aspects of this project, please contact the Falmouth University Research & Development Office at research@falmouth.ac.uk or 01326 259247.</p>

    <p>    I have read the information provided above and I understand that the survey is being conducted for the sole purpose of academic research. I acknowledge that participation is voluntary and any data I provide will be treated anonymously, confidentially and will be subject to rigorous data protection. I am also happy for my contributions to appear in a scholarly publication, on the condition that all such contributions are anonymous. Therefore, I consent to my involvement:</p>
